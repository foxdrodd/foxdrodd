#### Hi fellow Hacker 👋

I'm a systems hacker in the traditional sense, I 💖 to solve problems, gain understanding of deep software and kernel issues.
I enjoy the exploration of vintage computing systems in the context of up-to-date toolchains and kernels.

I’m currently working on improving Sega Dreamcast (SuperH), Playstation 3 (PowerPC64) in the linux software ecosystem and the kernel itself. These are communities with already very strong and motivated people, still leaving an opportunity for beginners.

I am very proud of my marginal linux kernel contributions, only possible because I met the most kind and encouraging people in [linux-sh](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-sh/):
see my contributions in [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Atorvalds%2Flinux+author%3Afoxdrodd&type=commits), it's so much fun!

Outside the kernel I enjoy contributing to [T2/Linux](https://github.com/rxrbln/t2sde/commits?author=foxdrodd), the distribution that only supports every CPU architecture ever out there and keeping it the most up-to-date and functional distro for all possible vintage and modern high-end systems.

My previous work revolves around kernel internals and the ecosystem:

- Kernel drivers (networking, DMA engines, input subsystems, storage)
- Maintaining T2/Linux: fixing packages, adding patches
- Reverse Engineering and Debugging in the late 90s
- Playing with linux on devices, I currently own: Dreamcast, Playstation 3, Sun Ultra 5, Sun Blade 150, HP Jornada 680, HP c8000, MilkV Duo 256M RISCV, ESP32s3, iCEBreaker FPGA, Raspberry PI 2,3,5, Clockwork uConsole, Apple A1103 Mac Mini, BPI-2K0300 Loong, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite ERLite-3 (mips64) (I am still looking for Alpha, Itanium and some m68k, just saying 😉 )

Feel free to get in contact if we share interests or you got issues with some of your vintage systems!
